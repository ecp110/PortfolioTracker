### WIP ###
This is a python script which looks to turn all of your trades into a visualised portfolio with price and valuation tracking.

Current features:
* Turns a csv of trades into a csv of both open and closed position dates
* Turns a csv of trades into a current portfolio displayed in the terminal window

Future features (pipeline):
* Use position dates to pull pricing information and day by day value of the position
* Use pricing information to calculate portfolio value
* Calculate portfolio return
* Look at highest and lowest performing positions (open and closed)
* Visualise return over time (% return per week, track $100 as invested at inception)
* Table of returns (monthly)
